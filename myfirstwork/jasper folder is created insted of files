Investigation steps we followed: 
>Logged in to the asusw22testk3aks and get pods. 

>Logged in to the jasper check the files and folders 

>Found error : application.properties, context.xml and js.quartz.properties are getting created as folder instead of files hence japser report server is not getting deployed.(please refer screenshot for error 

  

>This error with Validate failed: We want files but here we found directory insted of files 
 
 

RCA:If a directory is causing issues in your pipeline, first confirm its relevance and potential consequences before deletion. After backup and verification, deleting the directory might be a valid solution. 

Resolution : 

> Login into cluster asusw22testk3aks describe jasper note pvc or pv. which pvc it was attached. 

>Go to the azure portal find logic app and ignio-upgrade-testing see the logic 

>go to azure portal and find that PV or PVC in storage account 

>In storage account at file share you find that directories delete that folders 

>reRun the pipeline again it was resolved.
