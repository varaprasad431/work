In actually in kubernetes we have yaml is play most role because it was used as the input for creating the object in kubernetes  

In this objects are pods nodes services deployments etcâ€¦ 

 

Api version 

kind 

 

V1 

V1 

Apps/v1 

Apps/v1 

POD         Service       ReplicaSet Deployment     

 

Yaml is file that is used as input to create a object in kubernetes 

It contains mainly four sections 

1.apiVersion 

2.kind 

3.metadata 

4.spec 

 

Lets create yaml file for that  

 

Name of the yaml file    pod-defination.yaml 

apiVersion: v1             -> here it is write in string format 

Kind: Pod                     ->   here it is also write in string format 

Metadata:                   -> here we  write it in dictionary format and here it have parent and child in that 

  name: my-pod app       

  label:  

    name: myapp 

    type: front-end 

Spec:                          -> here it is write in List/Arrya format it contains so many formats 

   containers: 

     -  name : nginx 

        image:  nginx 

 

 

To create  pod using yaml fole this command is used 

 

Kubectl create -f pod-defination.yaml 

 

 

To get the list pod use this command: 

Kubectl get pods 

 

To get the detailed about pod: 

Kubect describe pod  {podname}
