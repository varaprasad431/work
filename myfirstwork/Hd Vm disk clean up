Step 1 :  search vm name aheurw1hdpn01 in azure portal 

Step 2 : Connect to Vm through Bastion like <<window>> 

Step 3: open putty and copy private Ip address from VM and paste in putty then connect with ignio credential 

 

/note/****Once connected to the VM via PuTTY, you can use command-line tools like df and du to check disk usage and identify large files or directories. 

Use commands like du -h --max-depth=1 / to list the sizes of directories in the root filesystem 

*****/note/ 

Step 4: Df -h then we got list  here we got  the list of diretory  here we check the version of the diretory you can use  the latest version those directory. 

Step 5: if some condition we use this command 

/ignio/hadoop-3.1.4/bin/hdfs dfs -rm -r /tmp/hadoop-yarn/staging/hbase/.staging 

Step 6: In some cases authenticity was rejected due to authenticity due to security reason at time u can use this   

Step 7: then we use  0)ll may be if requires 1)cd hadoop-3.1.4/etc/security/   2) klist -kt hdfs.service.keytab  

              3) kinit -kt hdfs.service.keytab hdfs/ahuse21hpnd04.inignio.com@AHUSE21RG.COM 

Step 8: we use 

/ignio/hadoop-3.1.4/bin/hdfs dfs â€“ll /tmp/hadoop-yarn/staging/hbase/.staging 

 

/ignio/hadoop-3.1.4/bin/hdfs dfs -rm -r /tmp/hadoop-yarn/staging/hbase/.staging 

 

 

*****Perform Cleanup: 

You can navigate to directories with large disk usage and delete unnecessary files using command-line commands, such as rm for removing files and rmdir for removing directories.

Here it was  working
